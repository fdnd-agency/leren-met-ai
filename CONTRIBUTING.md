# Team Contributing
All code is created according to the conventions of [FDND Agency](https://github.com/fdnd-agency/.github/wiki/Workflow-conventions).

## `Git workflow`
We use the FDND [gitflow](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/git-flow#the-git-flow-workflow):
- Nobody works directly on the `development branch`!
- Every team member works in their own `feature branch` that starts from `development`.
- Once the work is done, you open a `Pull Request` tot `merge` your `feature branch` back into `development`.
- Teammates `review and test` your work before it is merged.
- The `development branch` collects all approved work and serves as the `integration branch`.
- only after `teacher approval`, the code from development will be `merged into the main branch` as a `release`.
- The `main branch` is alway the `stable production branch`.

### How to create a branch
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28d0b538-718e-4b91-a93c-a337127818d4)
- Use the `development tool` for creating new branches. Here Github automatically creates a new branch from a created issue.
- This tool can be seen in the right column menu of an issue.

### `Branch naming convention`
The name of a branch is: `feature-component-name` (feature-navbar)

### How to make commits (e.g. “Use clear commit messages in the form of: [type]: [description]”).
"At FDND Agency, because of Semantic Versioning, we use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Conventional commit is a specification, a set of rules that have to be followed when writing commit messages."

**Allowed Commit types:**
- `build: ...` Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `chore: ...` Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
- `ci: ...` Changes to CI configuration files and scripts (GitHub Actions, netlify.toml)
- `docs: ...` Changes to documentation, eg: Readme.md, Handover.md or Figma files or design rationale in the Wiki
- `feat: ...` Implementing a new feature
- `fix: ...` Fix for a bug, style or layout issue
- `perf: ...` A code change that improves performance
- `refactor: ...` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature but improves structure or readability
- `style: ...` Changes that affect readability but not the working of the code (source formatting, adding tabs or newline)
- `test: ...` Adding missing or correcting existing tests

## How to create and review pull requests.
Use the pull request template which you automagically get when creating a PR in one of our repositories.

Please make sure you follow the following rules:
- Write small PR's
- Review your own PR first
- Provide context and guidance

## Workflow

### `Issues`
We work based on issues in the projectboard.
`An issue can be:`
- a `feature` (new functionality or component),
- a `bug` (fixing errors),
- a `task` (supporting work such as refactoring or styling),
- or `documentation` (README, design notes, handover).

We use `epics --> user stories --> tasks` to break work into manageable parts. Each issue is small, clear, and `assigned to at least one team member with a deadline`.

### `MoSCoW prioritisation`
We prioritise issues with the `MoSCoW` method:
- `Must have:` essential for delivery.
- `Should have:` important but not critical.
- `Could have:` nice to have extras.
- `Wont have (for now):` not included this sprint.

### `Projectboard rules`
- Each week, one team member is responsible for maintaining clarity and order on the projectboard.
- Do not assign too many tasks to yourself at once.
- Set realistic deadlines when you pick up an issue.
- Keep the board up to date: correct columns, labels & assignees.

### `Documentation rules`

- Write clearly in issues what you have done and document iterations of your work.
- Make small commits with clear descriptions.
- Pull requests must include guidance on what specifically needs to be reviewed, supported with screenshots or recordings.
- Check with teammates whether documentation is clear.
- Document in the README which features have been implemented.

## `Definition of Ready (DoR)`
- The story has a clear title and description  
- Includes a checklist with acceptance criteria
- All required information and files are available
- Poker planning has been completed
- Everyone in the team understands the story

## `Definition of Done (DoD)`
- Code runs without errors
- All acceptance criteria of the story are met
- Code has been reviewed by a team member
- Functionally tested
- Merged into the `dev` branch
- Deployed to the test environment

## `Delivery checklist`
Before delivery, make sure:
- README.md is complete.
- Projectboard is up-to-date with all issues (closed,prioritised).
- All code reviewed and tested (lighthouse-, accessibility-, browser/device-, usertests).
- No open pull requests remain.
- Code is clean: unused files/code removed, structure refactored.
